The TAG Register’s development was led by Public Law Project’s Tatiana Kazim and Mia Leslie, with much valued input and assistance from the wider team at Public Law Project.

Public Law Project works closely with the following organisations and is grateful for their research in this area, and their input into the content and design of the TAG Register: Lighthouse Reports, Privacy International, The Digital Constitutionalist, Amnesty Tech, and Kaeylynn Narita (PhD Candidate at Goldsmiths, University of London) and Connie Hodgkinson Lahiff (PhD Candidate at University of East Anglia).

The Register will be updated on an ongoing basis. Get in touch if you have any information to help build a better picture of how these tools work, would like us to investigate a suspected automated decision-making system, or you have thoughts and suggestions on increasing its usability.
