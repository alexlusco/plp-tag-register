Whether you offer front line support to people in the welfare, or immigration system, are a legal practitioner representing individuals in cases against the police, or a public body has recently made a decision about you - there is a high chance that you have encountered an element of automated decision-making (ADM).

The TAG Register can help you better understand how decisions that impact the people you work with, or those made about yourself, are reached. By bringing together information about known forms of automation in a user-friendly platform, the TAG Register makes information about automated decision-making accessible and understandable. 

The information can be viewed in a ‘simplified’ or ‘detailed’ version, so you can see the information most relevant to what you want to know. If you are curious about one specific decision-making tool, or want to explore automated tools identified within specific policy areas, you can toggle the dashboard to easier navigate the site and find you are interested in. 

The Register will be updated on an ongoing basis. Get in touch if you have any information to help build a better picture of how these tools work, would like us to investigate a suspected automated decision-making system, or you have thoughts and suggestions on increasing its usability.
